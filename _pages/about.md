I am an Astronomy PhD candidate at Columbia University. I think about cosmology, simulations, numerical methods for analysis. I have been working mostly with Dr. Shy Genel at the CCA and Prof. Zoltan Haiman here at Columbia. For more information on my research or for my full CV check out the Research and CV tabs respectively.
